Disassemble the transmitter and locate the pins of push button on the circuit board.

Solder one wire to a pin marked with blue and the other to a pin marked with red. Secure the wire to the circuitboard with some electric tape to relief the strain.

Route the cable to outside of the transmitter case. I made a hole to the soft rubber of the push button.

Solder the mercury switch to the other end of the cable and secure with electric tape. I also added a rare earth magnet for mounting to the mailbox lid.
