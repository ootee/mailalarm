* a piece of two-wire cable
* soldering iron and some soldering wire
* electrical tape
* magnets

## making of

Disassemble the transmitter and locate the pins of the push button on the circuit board.

Solder one wire to a pin marked with blue and the other to a pin marked with red. Secure the wire to the circuitboard with some electrical tape to relief the strain.

Route the cable to outside of the transmitter case. I made a hole to the soft rubber of the push button.

Solder the mercury switch to the other end of the cable and secure with electrical tape. I also added a rare earth magnet for mounting to the mailbox lid.

Reassemble the case.

Tape some more magnets to the case for mounting inside the mailbox.

![receiver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ootee/mailalarm/main/images/receiver.jpg)

The door bell receiver was left pretty much original with the exception of some electric tape over the speaker to dampen the alarm tone.

![transmitter placement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ootee/mailalarm/main/images/transmitter_inside_mailbox.jpg)

Secure the transmitter inside the mailbox with help of magnets. You can tuck the excess cord between the receiver and sidewall of the box.

Place the switch on the lid of the mailbox so that mercury makes contact with the pins when the lid is opened.

No more unnecessary trips to the mailbox!
